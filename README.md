# Poll-Website
Website created for Polls. The website was created using PHP, Bootstrap, jQuery, and MySQL. In order to run this application, you will need a Apache, as the web server, and MySQL. I tested this applcaiton with a program called XAMP, which conveniently has Apache, PHP, and MySQL installing in one place. It is great for running and testing full-stack systems on a local server. 
 The database is set up very simple, where there is only a single table.I would have structured this diffrently in a real world enivorment, but I for this porject, I wanted to see if I coudld implement all of my class requirements into a single table.
 I did this by storing answers into a single string, where the string is parsed and updated, based on the answer chosen. 
 For example, if a poll is created and only has two options, the string of answers created to store the answers will be “0,0”. However, if a poll with three options is created, the string of answers will be “0,0,0”. 
 If the user then votes on the second option of the three-option poll, the string answer will be parsed and will account for the vote. Where it will then be stored back into the database as “0,1,1”. A picture of my database design is included and is called “DB”.
